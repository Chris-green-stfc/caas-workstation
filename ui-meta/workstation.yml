  This workstation can be accessed using a web browser via the [Web console service]({{ webconsole.url }}) or by SSH.

  The SSH key of the user that deployed the workstation is injected into the `ubuntu` user:

  ```
  $ ssh ubuntu@{{ cluster.outputs.cluster_access_ip | default("[cluster ip]") }}
  ubuntu@{{ cluster.name }}-workstation:~$
  ```
  {% else %}
  This workstation can be accessed via a web browser using the [Web console service]({{ webconsole.url }}).
  {% endif %}

  The data volume is mounted at `/data`, and content stored there will persist for the lifetime
  of the workstation. Other parts of the filesystem may be affected during a patch operation,
  including any packages that have been installed using `apt`.

  Monitoring dashboards for the workstation are available using the [Monitoring service]({{ monitoring.url }}).
